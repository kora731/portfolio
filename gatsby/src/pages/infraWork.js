                <span>The first project I lead designing at Autodesk is to deliver an engaging first experience to help users get started with InfraWorks 360, a civil engineering design software with data-rich 3D models. During the customer journey, First Experience covers multiple touch points where users get onboard with the product and develop design skills using InfraWorks 360. Its components consist of product installation & update, first product launch, trial experience and in-product help where the design helps a novice user become an expert.</span>

                <span>When I presented the installation flow to customers, they were very excited about the curated experience and proposed that if it could help personalize the product UI. Unfortunately the installation tool didnâ€™t get built into product in the end, but there is a lot of learning for product feature development where we could onboard users with curated and personalized experiences. </span>
