                <span>The first project I lead designing at Autodesk is to deliver an engaging first experience to help users get started with InfraWorks 360, a civil engineering design software with data-rich 3D models. During the customer journey, First Experience covers multiple touch points where users get onboard with the product and develop design skills using InfraWorks 360. Its components consist of product installation & update, first product launch, trial experience and in-product help where the design helps a novice user become an expert.</span>
