                <span>Jaunt flagship product Jaunt One camera is paired with the camera controller application to access a wide variety of features. While connecting to the camera, users can adjust the camera exposure, capture preview and even get real time views. Jaunt media manager is the gateway tool to transfer recordings between VR camera, cloud services and user local data. It organizes 24 camera footage into formats ready for ingestion, to upload and download from the cloud.</span>

                <span>Fast and slow:  During the first week of joining Jaunt, I was able to design the download module right away. However, in the following months, I start learning more about how users actually interact with the Media Manager, only to discover the initial download dialog is not addressing the key pain points. Then I started slow iteration of the download dialog, to craft each interaction to support the user tasks better. The easiest and most accessible, right at hand, solution always poses high risk to actually solving the problem. Because it mostly overlooks the factors and edge cases, and that's where UX matters most. It has to be thought through with all use cases, and test against all possible routes.</span>
                <p/>
                <span>Camera is very prevalent in our daily life. But the adjustable controls vary a lot between mobile and professional cameras. Optimizing the UI layout alone doesnâ€™t help address the workflow problem. Also with so much customization involved, how to uncover the mental model is also critical.</span>
